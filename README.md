# SkinSwitcher

This mod adds markers in Vice City which can be used for changing and buying skins for player.

## Customization
You can also add new points on the map for yourself. To do that, create new cleo script, include "skinSwitcher.txt" file to your script like this: `{$INCLUDE skinSwitcher.txt}`. Then call `@CreateSkinSwitcher` function via [05F5](http://gtagmodding.com/opcode-database/opcode/05F5/) opcode to create new marker.
You can find an example of script in [skinSwitcherPoint.txt](https://github.com/PrographerMan/skin-switcher/blob/master/skinSwitcherPoint.txt) file.

You can find points on map here:

| Ocean View apartments        | GASH shop in The North Point Mall           |
