# SkinSwitcher

This mod for GTA Vice City adds points of changing and buying skins for player. You can also use this script to add new points on the map. You will need to include the file "skinSwitcher.txt" to your script-file like this: `{$INCLUDE skinSwitcher.txt}` and use opcode [05F5](http://gtagmodding.com/opcode-database/opcode/05F5/). An example there is in [skinSwitcherPoint.txt](https://github.com/PrographerMan/skin-switcher/edit/master/skinSwitherPoint.txt) file.

You can find points on map here:

| Ocean View apartments        | GASH shop in The North Point Mall           |
